OVERVIEW: This project was created as part of a semester-long class assignment focused on developing a prototype in various fields of work. Our group chose the medical field and designed a web application aimed at helping healthcare professionals manage patient records, appointments, and moreâ€”accessible directly from their mobile devices, even when outside of the office.
The goal of the application was to provide a convenient and secure way for authorized healthcare workers to handle sensitive patient information, with role-based access to ensure only qualified individuals could view or edit specific data.

PURPOSE: To give doctors and healthcare staff remote access to essential patient information and scheduling.
KEY FEATURES: view and manage patient records, access appointment schedules, role-based permissions for sensitive data, calendar integration for patient appointments

MY CONTRIBUTION (Roni Espiritu): I was responsible for developing the calendar feature, which integrates with Google Calendar to create and store patient appointments. In addition to development, I also assisted with quality assurance by testing features, identifying bugs, and helping ensure the overall functionality of the application met our project goals.

REFLECTION: We worked on this project throughout the semester, meeting twice a week during class time to collaborate. While the prototype is not fully functional, it was a valuable experience for us to explore the software engineering process, learn new technologies, and work as a team. For most of us, this was our first time building something of this caliber while dabbling into the software engineering world. We faced challenges but collaborated well, problem-solved effectively, and gained hands-on experience working as a development team.

DEPLOYMENT: This project was originally hosted on AWS for demonstration purposes during our final presentation. However, access to the hosted environment has since expired, so a live version is no longer available.
